The Woodwind Fingering Guide
============================

These are the WordPress theme files for an in-development new version of [The Woodwind Fingering Guide](http://wfg.woodwind.org). It is currently a child theme of [Montezuma](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/montezuma), hence its minimalism, but will likely change soon to something custom, perhaps built on [_s](http://underscores.me/).

Why Plugins?
------------

As some of the custom templates are built, you will likely notice functions being used from the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://advancedcustomfields.com/) plugin. Though your humble current developer generally writes custom metaboxes, in this case we've chosen to use a very lovely, very powerful plugin to power custom metaboxes so that a future non-technical but savvy administrator can still make changes or add features as needed. Of course, some comfort with PHP is needed to then use that data to influence the site display, but there is a lower barrier to that than to writing a custom metabox.

Why WordPress and GitHub?
-------------------------

As tends to happen with most sites, especially ones born of goodwill, maintenance of content and the backend tends to slow down or cease over time, and introducing a new maintainer is often a little bit difficult due to the spread of information or loss of a previous maintainer. By utilizing the power of open source, we hope to at least reduce the chances of that stagnation.

By using a content management system (CMS) such as [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), we empower non-technical but passionate users to become editors and authors of the content of the site. The more brains we have and the lower the barrier to being an effective contributor, the more likely it is the site will continue to be maintained over time, and even change hands if/when the time comes. Users can be given different roles, depending on whether they should be able to edit and add content or manage some of the more involved settings of the site.

By keeping the code and its history in a public place, we hope to both help ensure the future of the site and its code and, as a bonus, have some transparency in the behind-the-scenes workings. It also opens up the doors to contributions from anybody so-minded without having to give them direct access to something that will affect the live site. If you're curious, we're giving [DeployHQ](http://deployhq.com) a shot to manage deployment via FTP.
